The web application that was part of MQWeb is moved to a separate repository [MQWebApp](https://github.com/fbraem/mqwebapp).
---

The code for the web application is removed from the current development branch of MQWeb. The web application will be a totally rewrite as a Single Page Application for WebSphere MQ using [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) and [UIKit](http://getuikit.com/).

> This MQWeb App will only be supported from MQWeb 0.1.0. and above.
