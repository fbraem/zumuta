title: Poco Redis
---
For those interested in a Poco library for [Redis](http://redis.io) ... I've
created a [branch](https://github.com/fbraem/poco/tree/redis) on
my fork of the Poco repository. 
---

I know there is another attempt [here](https://github.com/RedisCppTeam), but
this project doesn't really follow the Poco coding standard and I can't read
Chinese comments. Besides that, it gives me also the opportunity to learn
another Pub/Sub solution. Currently only send/reply is supported.
Pub/Sub will be added soon ...
