From today on **Zumuta!** will be using Jekyll to generate a static blog website.

From today **Zumuta!** is using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to generate 
a static blog website. I have currently little time to create a dynamic website 
for **Zumuta!**. That's why this website didn't change a lot. Writing content 
for a static website is cumbersome. Some days ago, while reading on using project 
pages on [Github](https://github.com), I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) transforms plain text (Markdown) into static 
websites and blogs. I started on writing project pages for 
[MQWeb](http://www.mqweb.org) and thought "Why don't I use this for Zumuta!".
So here it is, the first post written in Markdown format and generated for you
with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
