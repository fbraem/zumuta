The first computer I saw was a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).
This computer made me decide to follow computer science at school. In 1989 I
finished my bachelor degree for informatics at the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be/kdg-in-english).

My first working experience was at the Belgian army. Yes, in 1990, military
service still existed. I developed a system in [Clipper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)) for storing medical
prescriptions in a [Dbase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBASE) database.

On my [LinkedIn profile](http://be.linkedin.com/in/frankybraem/) you can read
my full career. I started working for [KBC](http://www.kbc.be) in 1991. I've
done development in C/C++, Visual Basic, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, ... Since 2004
I'm part of the EAI team and develop programs for [Websphere MQ](https://www.ibm.com/products/mq) 
and Managed File Transfer. After 15 years, I left the MQ team, to join the network
automation team. My task is now to automate manual tasks. Scripts and REST APIs
are mainly written with Python.

My opensource experience started with [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org).
I wrote some tutorials and decided to write a port to JavaScript:
[wxJavaScript](http://www.wxjavascript.net). When wxWidgets abandoned
the Data libraries I started looking for a replacement, and I found [POCO](http://www.pocoproject.org).
Because wxJavaScript became more than wxWidgets the name changed into
 [GLUEscript](http://gluescript.sf.net): **Glu**eing libraries to **E**CMAScript.
While working on GLUEscript, I learned to write server side applications with
Apache and C/C++.

In **2010**, I started the [MQWeb](http://www.mqweb.org) project. This project was started
as a test that my idea to interact with [Websphere MQ](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/wmq)
using just a browser works. The JSON library written for MQWeb was contributed to POCO 1.5.2.

In **2011**, I wrote a [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) module for GLUEscript and I used this experience
to write a MongoDB library for POCO. This is also part of POCO 1.5.2.

Due to the success of node.js, my interest in GLUEscript faded away. The
 main focus went to the MQWeb project and the modules I contributed to POCO.

In **2015**, I contributed a [Redis](http://redis.io) module to POCO.

In **2019**, I still worked with IBM MQ, MQWeb and POCO. And at work I rewrote the
MQWeb portal in Python and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

When I left the MQ team for the network team, the MQWeb project was put on hold.

As a member of the board of the local judo club, I started working on a club
management system: Kwai. Kwai consists of two parts: a frontend ['kwai-vite'](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-vite)
which is written using Vue and Vite, and a backend ['kwai-api'](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-api) written in PHP.
You can see it in action on our club website [Judokwai Kemzeke](https://www.judokwaikemzeke.be).

I also manage websites for some societies/clubs. I've used [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org)
, [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org), [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org),
[Laravel](http://laravel.com), [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) and [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

Besides IT, cycling is also one of my favourite things to do. You can read
my [cycling stories](/cycling) also on this website.

Franky.
