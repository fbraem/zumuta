About
=====

The first computer I saw was a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).
This computer made me decide to follow computer science at school. In 1989 I
finished my bachelor degree for informatics at the [Karel de Grote-Hogeschool](http://www.kdg.be/kdg-in-english).

My first working experience was at the Belgian army. Yes, in 1990, military
service still existed. I developed a system in [Clipper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_(programming_language)) for storing medical
prescriptions in a [Dbase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBASE) database.

On my [LinkedIn profile](http://be.linkedin.com/in/frankybraem/) you can read
my full career. I started working for [KBC](http://www.kbc.be) in 1991. I've
done development in C/C++, Visual Basic, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, ... Since 2004
I'm part of the EAI team and develop programs for
[Websphere MQ](https://www.ibm.com/products/mq) and Managed File
Transfer.

My opensource experience started with [wxWidgets](http://www.wxwidgets.org).
I wrote some tutorials and decided to write a port to JavaScript:
[wxJavaScript](http://www.wxjavascript.net). When wxWidgets abandonned
the Data libraries I looked for a replacement and I found [POCO](http://www.pocoproject.org).
Because wxJavaScript became more then wxWidgets the name was changed into
 [GLUEscript](http://gluescript.sf.net): **Glu**eing libraries to **E**CMAScript.
While working on GLUEscript, I learned to write server side applications with
Apache and C/C++.

In 2010 I started the [MQWeb](http://www.mqweb.org) project. This project was started
as a test that my idea to interact with [Websphere MQ](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/wmq)
using just a browser works. The JSON library written for MQWeb was contributed to POCO 1.5.2.
In 2011 I wrote a [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) module for GLUEscript and I used this experience
to write a MongoDB library for POCO. This is also part of POCO 1.5.2.

GLUEscript is currently on hold. My main focus now goes to the MQWeb project
and the modules I contributed to POCO.

In 2015 I contributed a [Redis](http://redis.io) module to POCO.

In 2019 I still work with IBM MQ, MQWeb and POCO. At work I'm rewriting the
MQWeb portal in Python and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

I also manage websites for some societies/clubs. I've used [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org)
, [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org), [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org),
[Laravel](http://laravel.com), [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) and [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

Franky.
