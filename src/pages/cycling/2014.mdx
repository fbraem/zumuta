After two years, I decided to go for a new bicycle: a racing bike.
Not too expensive but still solid was the starting point and after much 
deliberation I came up with the "Specialized Secteur".

Last year we had seen that there were quite a few climbs nearby in Bormio, 
so we planned to return and stay a day longer, so we could do all the climbs. 
On the first day we climbed the Torri di Fraele (Cancano). This is not a hard
climb, but a very nice one. The many hairpin bends, which remind you a bit of 
the Stelvio, take you to the two towers. <i class="fas fa-gopuram" /> Completely different was the climb we
did in the afternoon: Bormio 2000. Like the previous one, this is a dead end 
climb. But this time you end up at a ski resort. <i class="fas fa-skiing" /> 

Like last year, on friday a tour was planned. But this time, the tour starts
with the Gavia and returns to Bormio by crossing the Mortirolo via Mono.
With the failure of last year still in my mind, I start this journey. During 
the climb of the Gavia I feel that the extra kilometers in the legs help. 6u34
later I'm back in Bormio: mission accomplished.

Last day of the stay was preserved for the Stelvio. On a rainy day we were at 
the top no less than 1 hour faster than last year: new material and better 
fitness were the ingredients for this success.
