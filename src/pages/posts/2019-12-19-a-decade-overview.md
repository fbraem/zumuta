What was I doing the last 10 years ...

# GLUEscript

In 2010 I was still working on [GLUEscript](http://gluescript.sourceforge.net), 
the successor of [wxJavaScript](http://www.wxjavascript.net). The
ultimate goal of GLUEscript was to create a JavaScript engine that turned
JavaScript into a general purpose language. In 2009 [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
was released, which proved that using JavaScript on the server was a great idea.
But the success of node, was also the reason why my interest into GLUEscript started
to fade away... Node uses the V8 engine (Chrome), which was open sourced in 2008,
while GLUEscript was using SpiderMonkey (Firefox). The last release of GLUEscript
was on 27 January 2012.

# POCO

While working on GLUEscript, I started to learn [POCO](https://pocoproject.org/).
I was writing a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) module for GLUEscript, so
I thought that maybe POCO could use a MongoDB package. In the meanwhile I also
worked on a JSON package. On 16 September 2013 the MongoDB package was
added to POCO 1.5.2.

# Redis

MongoDB was the first NoSQL database I got to know. The next one that got my
attention was [Redis](https://redis.io/). On 10 November 2017 a Redis package
was released with POCO 1.8.0.

# MQWeb

Another reason that my interest in GLUescript was fading, was [MQWeb](https://www.mqweb.org/). In 2010, MQWeb started as an opensource project to prove that my idea
 "use a REST api to manage WebSphere MQ" worked. I still don't know why this
 idea was thwarted, but finally in 2014 I was allowed to work on it during
 office hours. MQWeb was also my first project on [Github](https://github.com/fbraem).

# Zumuta

[Zumuta](http://zumuta.be) is my personal website/blog. Started in 2013 with the
idea to write more about open source, but I don't have enough time for it ...
One advantage of this work: I learned to generate static websites. Zumuta and
MQWeb uses [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com).

# Websites

In the meantime, I was also a webmaster for some clubs and associations. I used
[Xoops](https://xoops.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/). These content management systems learned me that it was always
difficult to upgrade to a next version when you have changed some code or integrated
some other modules. When I volunteered to manage a website and club management system
for a judo club I decided to write my own system. A like-minded colleague (thanks Bart!) was already
doing this for a volleyball club. This was the start of [Kwai](https://github.com/fbraem/kwai-ui). With Kwai, I now learn to write single page applications
with [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and REST api's with PHP.

# At work

In 2019, after 15 years, I left the MQ team and joined the network team to help them to automate recurring and manual tasks: Python, Flask, Ansible, ... Again time to learn a lot!
I don't know what the future of MQWeb will be, but I saw that [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_9.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q131110_.htm) also started to
implement my idea ...

> One thing that I learned from contributing to open source: I'm still relevant because I
continue to learn new technologies.
